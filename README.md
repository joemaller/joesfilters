# Joe's Filters for Final Cut Pro

This is my complete codebase for Joe's Filters. The last update was April 27, 2007. The first [Joe's Filters website snapshot][wayback 2001] in the Internet Archive is from August 2001.

This repository is provided as something of a historical record, or curiosity. There's some ugly, ugly hacks in here, but everyone's gotta start somewhere. 


> ***Note:*** These do not work with the latest version of Final Cut Pro. Apple discontinued support for FXScript 2011. Joe's Filters were created with that language. The Filters still work fine in older versions of Final Cut Pro. 


I've been meaning to post this for a while, but got hung up trying to write a decent Readme. This isn't that. The files are here, this file will be updated whenever I get around to it.

Thank you to everyone who used the filters, it was an amazing ride.
