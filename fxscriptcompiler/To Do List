Add edit button in Watermark code box
    - opens a file in BBEdit or editor from preferences
    - if no file is in box but text exists
        - Edit a new document, set contents to contents of watermark box
        
        
Store contents of watermark box in User Defaults.

Does that limit it's usefulness for other people? No. They just need to create a text file for their watermark...
